# The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch Project (3)

This is the third project required in The Odin Project Foundations Course.
For this project, it was requested to build a classic Etch-a-Sketch game that would allow the user to dynamically choose the size of the board and the format of the brush (white, rainbow or eraser).
The knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS and DOM management using JavaScript was used to carry it out. I hope you enjoy my result :)
